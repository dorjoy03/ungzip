This is a gzip decompression implementation written in C from scratch.
There is no compression part yet. Unlike gzip, it doesn't remove the .gz
file after decompressing. It just decompresses the .gz file into a new
filename without the .gz extension (if there is any file with the same
name in that directory it will be overwritten). It reads the .gz file into
memory, keeps decompressing members (supports multi-member) and keeps
writing to output file 8KiB (8192 bytes) at a time.

Implementation details are in rfc 1952 (gzip file format) and rfc 1951 (deflate).

If you want to test, just follow the below instructions to check the
validity of the program:

1. clone this repo
2. cd ungzip
3. make
4. cp file file-copy
5. gzip file
5. ./ungzip file.gz
6. cmp file file-copy

cmp should not output anything if decompression is working correctly.
